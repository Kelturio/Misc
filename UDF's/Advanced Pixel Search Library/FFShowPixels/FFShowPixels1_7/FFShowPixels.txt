FFShowPixels is a tool that will help you to manage list of colors, specially handy 
if you're using FastFind. 

You can group colors into categories, each category produce a named list. 

With this tool, you can easily see which (and how many) pixels have the different 
colors in your tree, either the colors you've checked, or a full category, 
or a single color. 
With context menu within the tree, you can make several actions on a specific color or 
a full category. 

Of course, you can save and reload your color lists, and also merge different lists. 

Best of all, FFShowPixel can automatically generate code (either in AutoIt .au3 format 
or .cpp/.h). 

Check "about..." in order to have some basic instructions.
