thanks Ward.



APNG and GIF are just from curiosity.
The images used are from Mozilla Firefox's APNG_Specification page (sample files),
availeable here https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification

..and a few from users post at the forum.

APNG.au3:
---------

APNG provides better quality animated image file at the cost of file size.
APNG.au3, right now, uses a run-time buffer that gets bigger and bigger as you
add more frames. To make APNG.au3 better, it's required to write each frame to a file,
then update the frame count of the file. Not a big problem, though.

APNG was written with the help of PNG specification and APNG specification.

GIF.au3:
--------

GIF provides small animated image file size at the cost of quality.
GIF.au3 does write directly to a file (lol it should have been the opposite).

GIF was written with the help of Rick Van den Bosch's blog:
"HOWTO: create an animated GIF using .Net (C#)"

Special thanks goes to wakillon for his Animated Splash examples and images ;3

..and to UEZ's wonderful GDI+ Examples thread which the Lingering_Lines example
is taken from. <3

AdvancedButton.au3:
-------------------

Just a miserable attempt to make different buttons.
